## How to get games

You can find here some games pre-configured for minimal memory usage: https://github.com/Gamelover7825/BRVM-PreconfiguredGames

You can find here some controls profiles for the _InputBridge_ app: https://github.com/Gamelover7825/BRVM-PreconfiguredGames/releases/tag/controls_ib


### How to run the pre-configured games directly from the homescreen


1. Make sure that a supported BRVM version is installed and completely set up, Termux allows _notifications_ and _drawing over other apps_
2. Install the provided utilities, _Activity Launcher_ and _Termux Widget_
3. Inside the virtual machine, create a folder _.shortcuts_ in _Z:\home_ if not exist, place there the shortcut script file for your game and BRVM version
4. Using _Activity Launcher_, run the _Termux Shortcut_ activity of the _Termux Widget_ app, and tap on the shortcut script file to add it to the homescreen
5. The game may be run minimized, tap _Termux_ in the notification panel to open it. If you have done everything correctly, your game will be run instead of the file manager
6. If the game does not run directly from the shortcut, enable _Force Landscape Orientation_ in _Termux-x11_ settings
7. Some games may require a specific action to be successfully run from shortcut
